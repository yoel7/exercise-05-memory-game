## Rules
- Cards are to be shuffled on load or restart
- Code should know how to handle matched and unmatched cards


## Extra medium
- UI should display the current number of moves a user has made
- The game should show a star rating (from 1–3) that reflects the player’s performance based on the number of moves made.
- When a player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start and once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
- A restart button should allow the player reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
- A congratulations modal should appear when the player wins while showing a button to play again and modal should show: How much time it took, and star rating.

## Extra hard
- The game should be saved to local storage and when the player exit and retunrs he keep play from the same point he left.
